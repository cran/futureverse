\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

The 'Futureverse' is a set of packages for parallel and distributed processing with the 'future' package at its core, cf. Bengtsson (2021) \doi{10.32614/RJ-2021-048}. This package is designed to make it easy to install common 'Futureverse' packages in a single step. This package is intended for end-users, interactive use, and R scripts. Packages must not list it as a dependency - instead, explicitly declare each 'Futureverse' package as a dependency as needed.
